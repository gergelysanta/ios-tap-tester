# iOS Tap Tester

When I replaced my broken display on my iPhone 6S with a cheap one from eBay, I realised that correct assembling is not everything. The display can be also faulty. That "new" display generated touch events randomly generating some upleasant events: calling my colleagues, writing obfuscated messages to my wife, etc.

So I decided to make an application to test my display. To see, what's happening there.

This small app was born. I made it public here, so people fixing iOS devices can also use it for testing new displays if they generate touch events correctly.

It visualises only basic events at the moment. Gestures are planned to be added later.

Events:
- taps
- 3D touch
- touch movements (single- and multitouches)
